### 1. Download and Clean refugee employment data

- Data downloaded as individual Excel files from:
- The code below was used to extract the total number of refugees, the fraction of working age
and the percentage employed for the top 10 most frequent refugee nationalities
- Nationalities were:
- Data does not include Ukrainians with S permits
